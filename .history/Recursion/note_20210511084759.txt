Recursion
_________
= a way of solving a problem by having a function calling itself.
- performimg the same operation multiple times with different inputs
-In every step we try smaller inputs to make the problem smaller.
-Base condition is need to stop the recursion, otherwise infinite loop will 
occur

why?
____
- helps you break down big problems into smaller ones and easier to use.
when to choose Recursion.
_________________________
=>if you can divine the problem into similar sub problem
=>Design an algorithm to compute nth
=>Write code to list the n..
=> Implement a method to compute all.
===> practice

- The prominent usage of Recursion in data struture like trees and graphs
- Interviews
- It is used in many algorithms (divide and conquer, greedy and dynamic programming)
